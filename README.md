## What This Demonstrates

When health IT projects fail, it's rarely because of bad technology. It's because of poor planning, misaligned stakeholders, and unrealistic expectations about timelines and outcomes. This logic model shows how I approach complex healthcare interventions: **with strategic frameworks that connect resource investments to measurable patient outcomes.**

This project taught me to think longitudinally about implementation: mapping how inputs flow through activities and outputs to create meaningful change. That skill became essential when I later designed an evaluation framework for an Integrated Out of OR Sedation Service Model in my workplace, translating course concepts into real-world clinical improvement planning.

## The Project

**Context:** MHI2009 - Evaluation Frameworks in Health Informatics  
**Team:** 4-person collaborative project (Rachel • Olajumoke • Kennedy • Ananya)  
**Scenario:** 500-bed teaching hospital implementing a Laboratory Information System

This interactive logic model maps the complete implementation journey, from initial resource allocation through to long-term institutional and community impact. It demonstrates how to structure complex health IT projects using evidence-based planning frameworks.

## My Contributions

**Activities Component:**  
Developed the framework for what actually happens during LIS implementation: system configuration, training, process optimization, and quality assurance. This required thinking through the operational reality of change management in clinical settings, not just theoretical best practices.

**Long-term Effects & Impact:**  
Mapped how short-term technical outputs cascade into medium-term operational improvements and ultimately long-term patient, institutional, and community outcomes. This longitudinal thinking was critical. It forced me to consider: *What does success look like 18+ months from now? How do we measure institutional excellence versus just technical completion?*

**Interactive Visualisation:**  
Built the GitHub-hosted interactive model to make this framework accessible and actionable for stakeholders. Technical delivery matters. Strategic documents sitting in PowerPoint don't create alignment the way visual, interactive tools do.

## From Course Project to Clinical Practice

This assignment fundamentally changed how I approach complex healthcare interventions. Within months of completing this course, I applied these logic model principles to design an evaluation framework for an **Integrated Out of OR Sedation Service Model** at my workplace.

While the sedation service wasn't purely a digital health intervention, it incorporated several digital health components: EMR workflow modifications, automated scheduling systems, and real-time monitoring integrations. More importantly, the **evaluation framework thinking** I practiced here transferred directly:

**The transfer:**
- **Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes** structure helped me articulate resource needs (staffing, equipment, technology) and expected ROI to administrative stakeholders
- **Timeline stratification** (short/medium/long-term) set realistic expectations with clinical leaders about when we'd see workflow improvements versus patient safety outcome changes
- **Explicit assumptions** surfaced dependencies early, identifying where we needed anaesthesia buy-in, nursing competency validation, and IT support before proceeding

The sedation service framework got stakeholder approval because it didn't just say "implement new service." It showed the path from multi-disciplinary inputs to reduced adverse events and improved patient throughput. That's the power of thinking in logic models, whether you're implementing technology or redesigning clinical services.

## Key Informatics Principles Applied

**Systems Thinking:**  
LIS implementation isn't just about software. It's about how laboratory workflows integrate with nursing, physician ordering, pharmacy, and quality reporting. The model emphasizes EMR integration and bidirectional data flow because isolated systems create isolated care.

**Workflow Redesign Over Automation:**  
The model distinguishes between "automating existing processes" and "enabling new ways of working." Technology should transform workflows, not just speed up broken ones.

**Change Management as Core Strategy:**  
Training and competency assessment are elevated to primary activities, not afterthoughts. Technical success means nothing if staff can't or won't use the system.

**Outcome Accountability:**  
Clear metrics at every stage create accountability. "Enhanced laboratory operations" is vague. "28% fewer transcription errors" is measurable.

## Reflections

**What I'd do differently:**  
If rebuilding this model for a real implementation, I'd add a "Risk Mitigation" component alongside "Key Assumptions." Making assumptions explicit is valuable, but identifying specific mitigation strategies shows operational maturity.

**What surprised me:**  
How much the timeline matters. We often expect immediate ROI from health IT, but this model shows why that's unrealistic. 28% error reduction happens within 6 months, but improved patient outcomes and accreditation readiness take 18+ months. Managing those expectations with stakeholders is critical.

**What I'd emphasize in different contexts:**  
For a community hospital, I'd weight "cost optimization" outcomes more heavily. For an academic medical center, I'd expand the "research enablement" and "teaching applications" impacts that LIS integration enables.

## Technical Notes

**Built with:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
**Hosted on:** GitHub Pages  
**Design principle:** Accessibility and stakeholder usability over complexity

The visualization allows users to explore components interactively rather than reading a linear document because different stakeholders care about different parts of the logic model (administrators focus on inputs/costs, clinicians focus on outcomes, IT focuses on activities).
